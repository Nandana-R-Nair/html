        <p>A web page (or webpage) is a document on the Web that is accessed in a web browser.[1] A website typically consists of many web pages linked together under a common domain name. The term "web page" is therefore a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book.Each web page is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL). When the user inputs a URL into their web browser, the browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then transforms it into an interactive visual representation on the user's screen.[2]

            If the user clicks or taps a link, the browser repeats this process to load the new URL, which could be part of the current website or a different one. The browser has features, such as the address bar, that indicate which page is displayed.A web page is a structured document. The core element is a text file written in the HyperText Markup Language (HTML). This specifies the content of the page,[3] including images and video.

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) specify the presentation of the page.[3] CSS rules can be in separate text files or embedded within the HTML file.
            
            The vast majority[4] of pages have JavaScript programs, enabling a wide range of behavior.[3] The newer WebAssembly language can also be used as a supplement.[5]
            
            The most sophisticated web pages, known as web apps, combine these elements in a complex manner.</p>
